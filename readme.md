Imposition Wizard

To whom it may concern,

This is a file imposer for multi-up stickers for large format printers/cutters. It's just an automation script for Adobe Illustrator.

Deliverables are:
Needs
-Needs to be able to impose with PDFs in illustrator if given the following (Quantity needed, PDF width, PDF Height, spacing between, filePath)
-Needs to loop through all PDF files in a folder
-Needs to be able to group like Infotechs and Print Files together
-

Would be nice
